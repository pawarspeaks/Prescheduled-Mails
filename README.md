# Prescheduled-Mails
This group project is built within 6 people in collaboration using Python.
It helps us to send mails in the future.
it needs an excel sheet to run, within which we need to add the date-time and the recipient's mail address on which the mail is supposed to be sent on the entered time and date, as well as the content of the mail is to be entered.
This project is built using 100% python language.
